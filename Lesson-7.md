## 7. Fundamentals of Software Architecture (Richards & Ford)

### Book Context
Modern comprehensive overview of software architecture covering architectural thinking, modularity, component-based thinking, quality attributes, and evolutionary architecture approaches.

### Key Principles
- **Everything is a trade-off**: Every architectural decision involves trade-offs; if it doesn't seem like a trade-off, you haven't identified the trade-off yet
- **Why is more important than how**: Understanding the reasoning behind architectural decisions is more valuable than memorizing solutions
- **Architecture is continuous design**: Architecture is not a phase but an ongoing activity throughout the software development lifecycle
- **Modularity matters**: Effective modularity through proper coupling and cohesion is fundamental to maintainable architecture
- **Evolutionary change**: Architecture must be designed to evolve as requirements, technology, and business needs change

### Key Practices
- **Architectural thinking development**: Learn to see systems holistically and understand trade-offs between different approaches
- **Fitness functions implementation**: Create automated checks that ensure architectural characteristics are maintained over time
- **Modularity analysis**: Regularly analyze and improve coupling and cohesion in system components
- **Architectural decision documentation**: Record not just what decisions were made, but why they were made
- **Continuous architecture**: Integrate architectural concerns into regular development practices

### Key Patterns/Models
- **Architecture Styles**: Monolithic, Distributed (microservices, service-based, event-driven, space-based, microkernel)
- **Component Identification**: Actor/Actions approach, Event Storming, Workflow approach
- **Architectural Characteristics**: Operational (performance, scalability, availability), Structural (maintainability, testability), Cross-cutting (security, compliance)
- **Data Architecture Patterns**: Single database, Database per service, Shared database, Data mesh
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Fitness functions, Incremental change, Guided change with fitness functions

### Architectural Relevance
Provides modern, practical framework for making architectural decisions in contemporary software development, emphasizing adaptability and continuous improvement.

### Quick Examples
- **Microservices Design**: Using component identification techniques to properly decompose monoliths, implementing fitness functions for service independence
- **Event-Driven Systems**: Designing for eventual consistency while maintaining system integrity through architectural characteristics
- **Data Architecture**: Choosing between shared databases and service-specific databases based on coupling and consistency requirements
- **Legacy Modernization**: Applying evolutionary architecture principles to gradually modernize existing systems

### Reflection Questions
What fitness functions could you implement to ensure your architecture maintains its desired characteristics over time? How can you better balance the trade-offs inherent in your current architectural decisions?
