## 2. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Martin Fowler)

### Book Context
Comprehensive catalog of architectural patterns for enterprise applications, focusing on data access, web presentation, distribution, and offline concurrency in business systems.

### Key Principles
- **Layered Architecture**: Organize code into layers with clear responsibilities and dependencies flowing downward
- **Domain Logic Organization**: Keep business logic separate from presentation and data access concerns
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Isolate database access behind well-defined interfaces and patterns
- **Distribution Strategy**: Minimize remote calls and design for network latency and failures
- **Concurrency Management**: Handle concurrent access to shared resources through appropriate locking and versioning strategies

### Key Practices
- **Layer responsibility definition**: Clearly define what each architectural layer is responsible for and enforce boundaries
- **Domain model protection**: Shield business logic from infrastructure concerns through abstraction layers
- **Database access centralization**: Use repositories and data mappers to centralize and standardize data access
- **Service interface design**: Design coarse-grained service interfaces that minimize network roundtrips
- **Transaction boundary management**: Carefully design transaction boundaries to balance consistency and performance

### Key Patterns/Models
- **Domain Logic**: Domain Model, Transaction Script, Service Layer, Domain Service
- **Data Source**: Repository, Data Mapper, Active Record, Table Data Gateway
- **Web Presentation**: Model-View-Controller, Page Controller, Front Controller, Template View
- **Distribution**: Remote Facade, Data Transfer Object, Service Stub
- **Offline Concurrency**: Optimistic Offline Lock, Pessimistic Offline Lock, Coarse-Grained Lock

### Architectural Relevance
Essential for designing scalable enterprise applications that handle complex business logic, data persistence, user interfaces, and distributed communication effectively.

### Quick Examples
- **Banking**: Domain Model for account management, Repository for transaction history, Service Layer for business operations
- **E-commerce**: Data Transfer Object for API responses, Remote Facade for order management services
- **Payment Systems**: Unit of Work for transaction processing, Identity Map for entity caching
- **Integration**: Gateway patterns for external system integration, Mapper patterns for data transformation

### Reflection Questions
How can you organize your system's business logic to maximize maintainability and testability? What distribution patterns would best support your system's scalability requirements?
