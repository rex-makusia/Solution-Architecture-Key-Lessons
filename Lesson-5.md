## 5. Software Architecture in Practice (Bass, Clements, Kazman)

### Book Context
Comprehensive guide to software architecture focusing on quality attributes, architectural tactics, patterns, and the relationship between architecture and business goals.

### Key Principles
- **Architecture serves stakeholders**: Architecture decisions must align with and serve the needs of all system stakeholders
- **Quality attributes drive architecture**: Non-functional requirements (performance, security, availability) primarily determine architectural choices
- **Trade-offs are inevitable**: Every architectural decision involves trade-offs between different quality attributes
- **Architecture influences organization**: Conway's Law - system structure mirrors communication structure of the organization
- **Documentation enables communication**: Architecture must be documented to be communicated and evaluated effectively

### Key Practices
- **Quality attribute scenario development**: Create specific, measurable scenarios for each important quality attribute
- **Architectural tactics application**: Apply proven tactics to achieve specific quality attribute goals
- **Architecture evaluation**: Regularly evaluate architecture against quality attribute requirements
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Identify and engage all relevant stakeholders in architectural decisions
- **Architecture documentation**: Create and maintain architectural documentation appropriate for different audiences

### Key Patterns/Models
- **Architectural Patterns**: Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven, Pipe-and-Filter, Client-Server
- **Quality Attribute Tactics**: Performance (caching, load balancing), Security (authentication, authorization), Availability (redundancy, failover)
- **Architecture Evaluation Methods**: ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method), SAAM (Software Architecture Analysis Method)
- **Documentation Structures**: Module views, Component-and-connector views, Allocation views
- **Architecture Reconstruction**: Reverse engineering and understanding existing architectures

### Architectural Relevance
Provides systematic approach to making architecture decisions based on quality requirements and stakeholder needs, essential for enterprise systems with complex requirements.

### Quick Examples
- **Banking**: High availability tactics for core banking systems, security tactics for customer data protection
- **E-commerce**: Performance tactics for peak shopping periods, modifiability tactics for rapid feature development
- **Payment Processing**: Security and performance tactics, with careful documentation of compliance requirements
- **Cloud Systems**: Availability and scalability tactics, with explicit trade-off analysis between cost and performance

### Reflection Questions
What are the most critical quality attributes for your system, and how do your architectural decisions support or hinder these attributes? How do you systematically evaluate trade-offs between competing quality requirements?
